# 1.2 Release

Version 1.2 is a major release with many new features and improvements. Including [API Keys](https://docs.better-auth.com/docs/api-keys), [Captcha](https://docs.better-auth.com/docs/captcha), [Stripe](https://docs.better-auth.com/docs/stripe), [Teams](https://docs.better-auth.com/docs/teams), and more.

## Stripe

Integrating payment processing, subscription management, and billing on top of your auth configs. The `@better-auth/stripe` package provides tools to handle customers, checkout sessions, and subscriptions.

### Installation

Install the Stripe integration package:

```bash
npm install @better-auth/stripe
```

### Usage

Set up Stripe in your Better Auth configuration as Plugin:

````typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { stripe } from "@better-auth/stripe";

const auth = betterAuth({
  adapter: memoryAdapter(),
  plugins: [
    stripe({
      apiKey: "your_stripe_api_key",
      webhookSecret: "your_webhook_secret",
    }),
  ],
});

## API keys
Manage API keys with built-in security, rate-limiting, and usage tracking. Create, update, delete, and validate keys while enforcing custom limits or metadata.

### Installation
Add the API key plugin:

```typescript title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { apiKey } from "better-auth/plugins";

const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [apiKey()],
});

```
## Captcha

- `--config` - The path to your Better Auth config file. By default, the CLI will search for a better-auth.ts file in **./**, **./utils**, **./lib**, or any of these directories under `src` directory.
- `--y` - Skip the confirmation prompt and apply the schema directly.

## BetterAuth CLI init

**Error: Cannot find module X**

If you see this error, it means the CLI canâ€™t resolve imported modules in your Better Auth config file. We're working on a fix for many of these issues, but in the meantime, you can try the following:

- Remove any import aliases in your config file and use relative paths instead. After running the CLI, you can revert to using aliases.

## Team Organization

The CLI also provides a way to generate a secret key for your Better Auth instance.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest secret
```
